						<p><strong>Question:</strong> I visited an amil who is also Molvi/hakim for my wife, she was felling uneasiness and her health was breaking down very often, he said someone from family has done some jadu on her. Before going to this amil I enquired about him in his locality, people gave me good feedback that he will not do any sort of shirk (polytheist), some people who visit him are Hafiz-e-Quran from nearby madrasa, and he performed Hajj (2011) this year too, his son is Hafiz-e-Quran from Sabilur Rashad Bangalore and he is assisting him. I personally asked him does his treatment involves any sort of shirk but he convinced me that he uses only Quran and does not involve shirk. He asked us to take a treatment course of 1 month, he gave us some water to drink/bath, small paper slips which is written with some number and text which we have to dissolve and drink/bath/apply on hairs, candles to watch them burn, and he made us cross the small pot (handi) 5 times. I would like to ask you that am I going to right amil? Please help me.</p>
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<p>Bismillah hir-Rahman nir-Rahim !</p>
						<p>(Fatwa: 221/85/L=1433) As there is a method for external treatment and it changes as per the situation of the patient in the same way there are some methods for internal treatment. There is no harm for going under such treatment provided it is not a shirkiya method. The holy Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) allowed to treatment with amulet and incantation provided the treatment does not carry any shirkiya acts. قال عليه السلام : لا بأس بالرقي مالم يكن فيه شرك . And when that amil is a Molvi and he is saying that his treatment does not bear any shirkiya act then you can undergo his treatment trusting his words. The things which he has given you for treatment apparently they do not have any shirkiya thing.</p>

						<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am in desperate need of advice or help. My dad is suffering from some unknown illness for last 2 years. No doctor could find out the reason for his illness. He could not eat anything, and if he does he vomits. I am guessing that some one has performed black magic on my dad. Request you to kindly advice what should I do in this situation.</p>
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<p>Bismillah hir-Rahman nir-Rahim !</p>
						<p>(Fatwa: 1086/909/=1433) If you doubt about black magic then you should contact any expert Amil. There is none in our Darul Ifta who works insufflations or charms.</p>

						<p><strong>Question:</strong> My elder brother often shouts and gets up in middle of his sleep. He does not have any medical disorder still he does that. What is the issue does he have any sifliyat or amliyat done on him by someone how to find out.</p>
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Bismillah hir-Rahman nir-Rahim !</p>
						<p>(Fatwa: 1313/1313/M=11/1434) If your brother does not have any medical problem then you should see any good and expert Amil. But if it occurs due to bad dream then he should recite اعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم and turn the side and sleep. Also he should recite Surah al-Nas and Surah al-Falaq before going to bed and blow on the body.</p>

						<p><strong>Question:</strong> My family have been victim of black magic. few days a ago my sister vomited and few pin came out which had knots. My Question is that, Can I ask molana to do bandish so nothing will harm us. What does Islam says about it? I heard a speech which says "if a person seek assistant his Imaan will be dismiss." Also if possible if you can advise what to do? My mother read manzil everyday and other surah from the Quran.</p>
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<p>Bismillah hir-Rahman nir-Rahim !</p>
						<p>(Fatwa: 1070/1070/M=1432) Treatment is not forbidden if one maintains the Shariah limits. If that Maulana sahib does the amal of bandish, you can get it done by him. And this should be adopted only as treatment and a cause. You must not believe this tawiz (talisman/amulet) effective in itself because it is only Almighty Allah who creates effects and one is cured only by His commandment. To seek help from other than Allah considering him powerful is wrong and false belief, but it is right to supplicate Almighty Allah by the wasila of others.</p>

						<p><strong>Removing contradiction between ahaadeeth of Ruqya, Amulet</strong></p>
						<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
						<p>Assalmau alaikkum Wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuhu, I have to discuss here some hadith regarding Ruqya, Amulet..</p>
						<p>I received mail quoting Ruqya,Amulet as shirk, the hadess quoted to proof are</p>
						<p>It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) say: &ldquo;Ruqyah, amulets and love charms are shirk.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood (3883) and Ibn Majaah (3530): classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood</p>
						<p>`Uqbah ibn `Amir Al-Juhani (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a group came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) to pledge their allegiance (bay`ah) to him. He accepted the allegiance of nine of them but not of one of them. They said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allah, you accepted the allegiance of nine but not of this one.&rdquo; He (the Prophet) said, &ldquo;He is wearing an amulet.&rdquo; The man put his hand (in his shirt) and took it off, then the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) accepted his allegiance. He (peace and blessings be upon him) then said, &ldquo;Whoever wears an amulet has committed shirk.&rdquo; (Reported by Ahmad) Now clarify me the meaning for these hadiths</p>
						<p>Narrated &lsquo;Aisha: Allah&rsquo;s Apostle used to read in his Ruqya, &ldquo;In the Name of Allah&rdquo; The earth of our land and the saliva of some of us cure our patient with the permission of our Lord.&rdquo; with a slight shower of saliva) while treating with a Ruqya. (Bukhari Book #71, Hadith #642) and lot more hadees regarding ruqya are available in Sahi sitta books,</p>
						<p>What is the difference between Ruqya in Abu Dawood (3883), Ahmad and the above hadith&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
						<p>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: Some of the companions of the Prophet came across a tribe amongst the tribes of the Arabs, and that tribe did not entertain them. While they were in that state, the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion). They said, (to the companions of the Prophet ), &ldquo;Have you got any medicine with you or anybody who can treat with ruqya?&rdquo; The Prophet&rsquo;s companions said, &ldquo;You refuse to entertain us, so we will not treat (your chief) unless you pay us for it.&rdquo; So they agreed to pay them a flock of sheep. One of them (the Prophet&rsquo;s companions) started reciting Surat-al-Fatiha and gathering his saliva and spitting it (at the snake-bite). The patient got cured and his people presented the sheep to them, but they said, &ldquo;We will not take it unless we ask the Prophet (whether it is lawful).&rdquo; When they asked him, he smiled and said, &ldquo;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a ruqya? Take it (flock of sheep) and assign a share for me.&rdquo; (Book #71, Hadith #632)</p>
						<p>Regarding amulet, is wearing amulets with Quran,hadees with beleif that it is ruqya, done by Prophet, is it shirk then what is the ruling regarding this hadith</p>
						<p>Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-&lsquo;As: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to teach them the following words in the case of alarm: I seek refuge in Allah&rsquo;s perfect words from His anger, the evil of His servants, the evil suggestions of the devils and their presence. Abdullah ibn Amr used to teach them to those of his children who had reached puberty, and he wrote them down (on some material) and hung on the child who had not reached puberty.( Abu Dawood book 28 hadees no 3884).</p>
						<p>What is the difference between Amulet in Abu Dawood (3883), Ahmad and the above hadith&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
						<p>Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas&rsquo;ud: The Prophet of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) disliked ten things: Yellow colouring, meaning khaluq, dyeing grey hair, trailing the lower garment, wearing a gold signet-ring, a woman decking herself before people who are not within the prohibited degrees, throwing dice, using spells except with the Mu&rsquo;awwidhatan, wearing amulets, withdrawing the penis before the semen is discharged, in the case of a woman who is wife or not a wife, and having intercourse with a woman who is suckling a child; but he did not declare them to be prohibited. (Book #34, Hadith #4210)</p>
						<p>What is the difference between Amulet in Abu Dawood (3883), Ahmad and the above hadith&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
						<p>So if a thing is not Prohibited then surley it will not be shirk Right ? then how fatwa of shirk can be given?</p>
						<p>Narrated Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) entered upon Thabit ibn Qays. The version of Ahmad (ibn Salih) has: When he was ill He (the Prophet) said: Remove the harm, O Lord of men, from Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas. He then took some dust of bathan, and put it in a bowel, and then mixed it with water and blew in it, and poured it on him. (Book #28, Hadith #3876) what is the action performed here is called as Ruqya or not? Put some light on above hadith also?</p>
						<p>Then how in Islam Q&amp;A it is given as Shirk ,that wearing Amulet having Quraanic, and prophetic duas as mean of Ruqya .</p>
						<p>Kindly give me a detailed explanation ,</p>
						<p>I have read book named &ldquo;ghanjina Asrar&rdquo; written my Maulan Anwar Sha Kashmiri Rahmatullahi, he had prescribed taawid, what is your opinion kindly put light on it.</p>
						<p>Jaza Khalla khairan</p>
						<p><br /><strong>Answer</strong></p>
						<p>Jazakallah for the detailed question &ndash; sometimes a good question has half the answer. You have also provided many hadiths which portray both sides of the mas&rsquo;ala.</p>
						<p>The misconceptions are due to just reading translations and not having an in-depth study of religious sources. This is why I have heard of a revert who was told to buy a translation of Saheeh Muslim and read through it, which he did, and when he saw some contradiction in the narrations he nearly became murtadd. He consulted the ulema, who explained, and he remained steadfast.</p>
						<p>Please note the following points:</p>
						<p>Ruqyah and amulets go hand in hand &ndash; if one is allowed, so is the other.<br />Hafidh Fadhlullah Toorpishti rahmatullahi alayhi, writes under the hadeeth &ldquo;Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam permitted ruqyah from al-ayn (evil eye), snake and scorpion bites and boils&rdquo;:</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Permission can only be granted after prohibiting, therefore he sallallahu alayhi wasallam had prohibited ruqyah, due to the possibility of some words of Jahiliyya being included in there, so people refrained from ruqyah; then he permitted those ruqyahs which are free from the words of Jahiliyya.&rdquo; (Mirqat, 8:356)</p>
						<p>So here is the first answer to your question: prohibition is mansookh (abrogated).</p>
						<p>Mulla Ali al-Qari rahmatullahi alayhi writes: &ldquo;There are plenty of ahaadeeth for both views. The way of combining both is to say that ruqyah is disliked when:</p>
						<p>It is done in a language other than Arabic (wherein one does not understand what he is saying or writing)<br />It is done with words other than the names of Allah subhanahu wa ta&rsquo;aala or other than His sifaat or His kalaam (Qur&rsquo;an)<br />A person believes that ruqyah in itself will definitely benefit, thus one relies on it. This is also mentioned in the hadith:</p>
						<p>ما توكّل من استرقى</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Whoever asks for ruqyah has not relied upon Allah.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>Also, the hadith:</p>
						<p>من اكتوى أو استرقى فقد برئ من التوكّل</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Whosoever brands his body or asks for ruqyah, then he has alienated himself from putting trust in Allah.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>Those ruqyahs which are not included in the prohibition will be allowed, e.g. ruqyah with Qur&rsquo;an, with the names of Allah and with those which have been narrated ahaadeeth.</p>
						<p>The hadith of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood radiallahu anhu which you mentioned has been narrated in Mishkat; Mulla Ali al-Qari writes under its commentary: &ldquo;The meaning of shirk here is that when a person believes that ruqyah and amulets have a huge effect, then this is shirk-e-khafiy (the hidden shirk); however, when a person thinks that it in itself is the cure, then this is shirk-e-jaliy (the apparent shirk) (e.g. paracetamol is beneficial for a headache; however, sometimes we take it, but the headache remains the same &ndash; this shows that the cure is in the hands of Allah. Now, if a person thinks that the tablet is hugely effective, then this is shirk-e-khafiy, and if he thinks that it in itself is the cure, then this is shirk-e-jaliy; one should think that it is only a source of gaining cure, otherwise the shifa is in the hands of Allah.</p>
						<p>I once went to a Chinese doctor for alternative medicine; my friend asked him: &ldquo;Do you have any medicine for so-and-so?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;I can cure that and this and this.&rdquo; The way he was saying it made him seem as though he is God and he can cure anything; this is shirk and this is what is meant in ruqyah, too. The Portuguese footballer Luis Figo used to wear an amulet and every time he would score a goal, he would kiss that amulet. This means he would think that the amulet made him score. One goalkeeper would put a lucky coin in his net and think that the coin saves goals. This is shirk.</p>
						<p>Qadhi Baydhawi rahmatullahi alayhi writes: &ldquo;Ruqyah can sometimes lead to shirk.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>Allamah Teebi rahmatullahi alayhi writes: &ldquo;This is why Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood said &ldquo;You, the family of Ibn Umme &lsquo;Abd, should be free from shirk,&rdquo; because taking ruqyah can delay the entry into Jannah, as mentioned in the hadeeth of the seventy thousand who will enter Jannah through fast track.</p>
						<p>Note: There are some hadith which mention the permissibility and some which mention the desirability of ruqyah:</p>
						<p>استرقوا لها فإنّ بها النظرة</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Search for some ruqyah for her, as she is affected by nazar (evil eye).&rdquo;</p>
						<p>جاء رجل إلى النبيّ صلّى الله عليه و سلّم فقال: يا نبيّ الله إنّي كنت أرقي من الحمّة و إنّك نهيت عنها، فقال: من استطاع أن ينفع أخاه فلينفعه</p>
						<p>A man came into the company of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam and said: O Prophet of Allah! I used to perform ruqyah from fever, whereas you have prohibited it. The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam replied: &ldquo;Whosoever has the ability to benefit his brother should do so.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>اعرضوا عليّ رقاكم لا بأس بالرقى ما لم يكن شركاً</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Show me your ruqyahs; there is no harm in ruqyah as long as there is no shirk.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>When Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam would fall ill, Jibreel alayhis salaam would blow on him while reciting:</p>
						<p>بسم الله أرقيك الله يشفيك من كلّ داء يؤذيك بسم الله أرقيك</p>
						<p>&ldquo;With the name of Allah do I blow on you. Allah will cure you from every ailment that is harming you. With the name of Allah do I blow on you.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>When Hasan and Husain radiallahu anhuma would be afflicted by nazar, Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam would blow on them with the following and say that Ibrahim alayhis salaam would do the same with Ismail and Is-haq alayhimas salaam:</p>
						<p>أعيذكما بكلمات الله التامّات من شرّ كلّ شيطان و هامّة و من كلّ عين لامّة</p>
						<p>&ldquo;I give you refuge, with words of Allah which are complete, from the evil of every shaytaan, every vermin and reptile, and every evil eye.&rdquo;</p>

						<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it permisible to Islam for a person wearing Tabij to protect him self from Jin or Kufri Kalam?</p>
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<p>Bismillah hir-Rahman nir-Rahim !</p>
						<p>(Fatwa: 1297/1035/B=1431)</p>
						<p>If no help is sought from jinn in the amulet and it does not contain any word of kufr and shirk (infidelity and polytheism) and he does not believe it to be effective in itself, then as per Shariah it is allowed to wear it.<br />و فى الحديث قيل يا رسول الله كيف ترى في ذلك؟ قال اعرضوا على رقاكم لا باس بالرقى ما لم يكن فيه شرك . رواه مسلم (مشكاة ص:388)</p>

						<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am a 30 year old female from Srinagar, Jammu &amp; Kashmir. I am having a worse nightmare that a woman is pulling my leg in the middle of the night while I am sleeping. When I am awake I can see an old lady starring at me besides my bed and she do not let me sleep and I will try to sleep again she hits me. This is the reason I cannot sleep whole night. One more thing if any time she hits me or grabs my arm or leg the very next morning I can clearly see the purple color brushes on my body. So please let me know what I will do.</p>
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<p>Bismillah hir-Rahman nir-Rahim !</p>
						<p>(Fatwa: 1686/1137/L=1433) That woman seems a jinni. Recite surah al-Falaq and surah al-Naas seven times before going to bed and blow on your whole body. If you suffered from the same problem again then contact any pious Amil.</p>

						<p><strong>&nbsp;Question:</strong></p>
						<p>Can we do Ruqya on non-Muslim/kafir? If yes, is there any condition?</p>
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.<br />As-salāmu &lsquo;alaykum wa-rahmatullāhi wa-barakātuh.</p>
						<p>It is permissible to perform ruqyah on a non-Muslim.[1] However, one should ensure that only verses of the Qurān, Dua&lsquo;s from Ahādīth, or the names of Allāh Ta&lsquo;ālā are recited.[2]</p>
